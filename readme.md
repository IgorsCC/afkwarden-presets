- IgorsPresets helps PVM beginners who want to learn new bosses by reducing the time and resources spent going to Death's Office through calling out mechanics during boss encounters.  
- IgorsPresets are created using the AfkWarden tool from [Alt1 Toolkit](https://runeapps.org/alt1) created by Skillbert.  
- All current boss presets are created using:  
  - The "General PVM Preset" that contains utility voice callouts for buffs, auras, potions etc.  
  - Learner friendly boss mechanic call-outs voiced by your favourite content creators aimed at making learning new bosses or group roles easier.  
- _**Igors Combat Companion**_, a standalone app, is being worked on in the background through a collaborative effort of talented individuals from the community to deliver the _One app to rule them all_ to the Runescape PVM community
