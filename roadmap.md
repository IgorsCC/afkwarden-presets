# Future IgorsPresets
- "General PVM Preset" to be used as a base for all future boss presets
- Zamorak 100% Enrage - P7 will be added once the community figures out an easy way to tackle the mechanics
- The goal for IgorsPresets is to ideally create a preset for all the bosses that have mechanics announced in the chatbox that allows this concept to work.
- The foundation set by IgorsPresets will be used to build a standalone app (a project that I have started together with a number of talented individuals from the community so if someone with coding experience wishes to collaborate please add me on discord "igor picard#2626" and we can discuss further)
