_**All bosses that can be covered by Igor's Presets are listed below:**_  
 - *Unfortunately, the rest of the boss encounters cannot have a guide due to their mechanics not being announced in the chatbox but rather through overhead text or solely telegraphed through animations. Unfortunately, we cannot detect these unless interfering with the client which is not acceptable to Jagex from what I understood. Maybe a future agreement can be reached to allow for all the bosses to be covered by this proejct, we never know.*
